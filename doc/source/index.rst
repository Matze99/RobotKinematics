Notes on the Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Throughout this documentation there are several equations regarding the kinematics of the robot.
In most equations, the initial superscript is not written. In every case, where usually there would be
a leading superscript, it is identically to the index.

   w_i \rightarrow {}^iw_i
