    "Since the code for the kinematics calculations creates own variables for the derivative, it is beneficial to use a common convention for the naming of the variables. Each prismatic joint is assinged a variable di and each rotational the variable ti (short for thetai). The i is substituted for the number of the joint, e.g. a RPRP robot has the variables t1, d2, t3, and d4."

This joint has no rotation, translation, or other parameters and serves as the world coordinate frame. The `END_EFFECTOR` is similar, but at the end.
